# Quest Analysis

## Project Goal
This project aims to analyze a dataset for meaningful patterns and insights, leveraging Python-based tools and techniques. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling to address key questions related to the dataset's context. The final objective is to derive actionable insights that can inform decision-making.

## Process Followed

### Data Understanding and Preparation
- **Dataset Overview**: Analyzed the structure, data types, and missing values.
- **Cleaning**: Addressed missing or inconsistent entries and performed transformations for standardization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigated trends, distributions, and correlations using visualizations.

## Summary of the results

### Asset Performance:

- Asset4 (purple) has the highest overall value and steady growth, with a noticeable dip around early 2020 but recovery afterward.
- Asset1 (blue) is the second-highest performer, showing stability over time with minor fluctuations.
- Asset2 (green) exhibits consistent growth, starting at a lower value but steadily increasing throughout the period.
- Asset3 (red) and Asset5 (orange) have the lowest values but maintain relatively stable trajectories with minor dips in early 2020.

Impact of Early 2020 (Possible Pandemic Effect):

All assets experienced a noticeable dip in early 2020, suggesting a potential market-wide event affecting asset values.

Asset4 and Asset2 were most impacted but showed strong recovery trends shortly after.
Volatility:

Asset4 appears to have the most significant swings, indicating higher volatility.

Assets3 and Asset5 have the least variation, suggesting lower risk but also lower growth potential.
Growth Patterns:

Asset2 has the most consistent upward trend, potentially indicating strong and reliable growth.

Asset4, despite its fluctuations, demonstrates significant growth potential with the highest value over time.

### Highly Correlated Assets:

Asset2 and Asset3 have the highest correlation (0.91), indicating they move together closely and might be influenced by similar factors.
Asset2 also has strong correlations with Asset4 (0.88) and Asset5 (0.83).
Asset3 is strongly correlated with both Asset4 (0.88) and Asset5 (0.87).

### Low Correlation Assets:

Asset1 and Asset5 have the lowest correlation (0.07), suggesting their values are almost independent of each other.
Asset1 also has weak correlations with Asset3 (0.37) and Asset2 (0.51).
Asset4 as a Central Player:

Asset4 shows moderately high correlations with Asset2 (0.88), Asset3 (0.88), and Asset5 (0.78), suggesting it shares trends with these assets but retains some independence.
Diversification Potential:

Asset1, with its weak correlations to most other assets, provides the best diversification opportunities in a portfolio.

The graph depicts the allocation of asset weights over time as a stacked area chart, with each segment representing a specific asset's contribution to the total weight (which sums to 1.0 at all times). Here's a summary:


## Weight Dynamics:

- Asset1 (blue): Maintains a stable weight contribution through most of the timeline, with slight reductions or increments at specific intervals.
- Asset2 (green): Shows a gradual increase in weight over time, becoming more prominent in the later periods.
- Asset3 (brown): Exhibits some variability, decreasing and increasing weight at different intervals.
- Asset4 (gray): Has a relatively stable weight across the timeline but shifts slightly around key points.
- Asset5 (light blue): Demonstrates significant adjustments in its weight allocation, with periods of high dominance and rapid decreases.
Timeline:

From mid-2019 through late 2021, the weights of assets dynamically shift, suggesting rebalancing or strategic adjustments in allocation at specific dates (e.g., January 2020, July 2020, January 2021).
Total Weight Constraint: The stacked area chart ensures that all assets combined always sum to 1.0, reflecting proportional adjustments among the assets.

### The annualized return of 0.08086 (or ~8.1%) represents the average yearly return the portfolio has generated over the analyzed time period.
### The annualized volatility of 0.07199 (or ~7.2%) represents the portfolio's level of risk or fluctuation in returns over a year.
